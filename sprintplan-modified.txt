Sprint Goals 

 

Primary Goals for the Sprint 

 

Close gaps on onboarding platform tasks and finalize end-to-end flow (Twilio to Telnyx migration, call routing, webhook architecture) and begin end-to-end testing. 

Advance CRM-related work: finalize high-priority CRM onboarding/integration features and complete deployment. 

Deliver privacy policy alignment and audit improvements across FECA/chatbot; publish website privacy policy updates. 

Complete 4Trades.ai Product Manager agent readiness: end-to-end testing, prompts architecture refinement. 

Address high-priority blocking issues (Azure permissions, IP whitelisting, and porting/telco routing lookups) to unblock downstream work. 

 

Notes: 

 

Previous Sprint Review: Completed items include telemetry/audit logging groundwork and privacy policy consolidation; sprint planning agent setup and Azure AD app registrations progressed; many onboarding, payment portal, and Telnyx/Twilio migration tasks were started but not completed. Partially complete tasks: End-to-end testing for sales/product manager bots, PIVH/PNW automation, onboarding platform integration. Pending items: Full CRM completion and then setting up for future CRM clients, Telnyx/Twilio migration completions, IP whitelisting, environment credential provisioning, and webhook architecture finalization. 

New sprint will carry forward all incomplete tasks from the previous sprint with explicit status updates, and integrate new work discussed in Teams messages (Azure AD app registrations, privacy policy updates, storage/cdn, and Telnyx/Twilio migrations). 
Ad-hoc bug fixes of issues raised by client of delivered products
